# ROS Basics: A Comprehensive Guide to Robotics Development

## Course Introduction
Welcome to **ROS Basics 8 Lectures**! This course is meticulously designed for beginners to build a solid foundation in ROS (Robot Operating System). Through a blend of theoretical concepts and hands-on practices, you will master the core tools and mechanisms used in modern robotics.

Whether you are working on a [reComputer Nvidia Jetson Orin](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J3010-w-o-power-adapter-p-5631.html) or a standard Ubuntu machine, these tutorials will take you from environment setup to complex tasks like coordinate transformations, empowering you to build your own robotic applications.

### What You Will Learn:
* **Environment Deployment:** Install and configure ROS on Linux.
* **Bilingual Implementation:** Master ROS development using both C++ and Python.
* **Core Communication:** Deep dive into Topics, Services, and the Parameter Server.
* **Execution Management:** Efficiently manage multiple nodes using Launch files.
* **Coordinate Systems:** Understand and implement TF (Transform) for robotic positioning.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure your hardware and Ubuntu 20.04 environment are ready.
2. Start your journey with [Chapter 1.1: Overview and Setup](./1.1-Overview%20of%20ROS%20and%20Environment%20Setup/README.md).
3. We highly recommend typing out the code manually and using tools like `rqt_graph` to visualize the node relationships.
