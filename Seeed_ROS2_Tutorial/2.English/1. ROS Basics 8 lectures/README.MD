# ROS2 Fundamentals: From Zero to One in Robotics Development

## Course Introduction
Welcome to the **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Fundamentals: 8-Part Course**! This course is designed specifically for beginners in robotics development, aiming to help you quickly master the core mechanisms of ROS2 through systematic theoretical explanations and hands-on exercises.

Whether you are working on a [reComputer Nvidia Jetson Orin](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J3010-w-o-power-adapter-p-5631.html) or a standard Ubuntu environment, this course will take you from environment setup through to core technologies like communication mechanisms and coordinate transformations, laying a solid foundation for building complex robotic applications.

### What You Will Learn:
* How to deploy and configure ROS2 systems in a Linux environment.
* Mastering dual-language implementation using C++ and Python in ROS2.
* Deep understanding of Topics, Services, and Parameters.
* Learning how to manage multi-node execution using Launch files.
* Mastering TF coordinate transformations, which are crucial for robotics development.

## How to Start
1. Ensure your hardware device is ready.
2. Start your learning journey with [1.1-ROS2 Overview and Environment Setup](./1.1-Overview%20of%20ROS%20and%20Environment%20Setup/README.md).
3. It is recommended to write the code manually during the learning process and use tools like `rqt_graph` to observe node relationships.
