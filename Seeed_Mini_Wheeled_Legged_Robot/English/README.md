# Mini Wheeled-Legged Robot Tutorial Track

Welcome to the **Mini Wheeled-Legged Robot Tutorial Track** - a systematic, engineering-oriented course on wheeled-legged robot motion control.

This tutorial is built around a real, fully functional wheeled-legged robot platform. It progressively presents a complete technical roadmap, from **fundamental self-balancing control** to **advanced motion control algorithms**.

## Course Description

This tutorial is a systematic, engineering-oriented course on wheeled-legged robot motion control, built around a real, fully functional wheeled-legged robot platform. It progressively presents a complete technical roadmap, from **fundamental self-balancing control** to **advanced motion control algorithms**.

The course focuses on the core challenges of wheeled-legged robots, including:

* Pitch self-balancing and closed-loop velocity control
* Attitude control and terrain-adaptive algorithms
* High-mobility motion enabled by parallel bionic leg control
* Advanced motion control methods such as LQR and VMC
* Training wheeled-legged robots using reinforcement learning
* Other applications and algorithm development for wheeled-legged robots

The tutorial combines mathematical derivations with strong engineering insight, emphasizing the workflow of **"physical meaning → control logic → deployable code."** This approach helps learners truly understand *why* each control algorithm is designed, *what problem it solves*, and *how it is implemented on a real robot*.

## What You Will Learn

* Build a stable and controllable wheeled-legged robot self-balancing system from scratch
* Master motion control methods that are proven and usable in real engineering practice
* Establish a solid foundation for advanced research in robot control, reinforcement learning, or product-level development
