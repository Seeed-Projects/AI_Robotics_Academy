# ReachyMini Desktop Robot Course: From Basics to Advanced Development

## Course Introduction
Welcome to the **ReachyMini Desktop Robot Course**! This course is designed for robotics beginners and educators, aiming to help you quickly master the core control techniques and secondary development capabilities of the ReachyMini desktop robot through systematic theoretical explanations and hands-on practice.

ReachyMini is a powerful educational robotic arm equipped with controllable components including head, antennas, and body, supporting rich sensor interfaces such as cameras, audio, and IMU. This course will take you from basic operations to advanced techniques like kinematics, interpolation, and asynchronous control, building a solid foundation for complex robotic applications.

### What You Will Learn:
* **Environment Setup**: Connect and configure ReachyMini robot (including network connection and simulation mode).
* **Component Control**: Master precise control methods for head, antennas, and body components.
* **Media Integration**: Learn camera and audio functionality development and applications.
* **Kinematics**: Deep dive into forward/inverse kinematics and coordinate transformations.
* **Motion Planning**: Master trajectory interpolation and motion recording/playback techniques.
* **Advanced Control**: Learn asynchronous control and parallel task processing.
* **Practical Projects**: Enhance development skills through rich real-world examples.
